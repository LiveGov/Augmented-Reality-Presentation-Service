Quick Guide to build an Android AR app for urban planning using the MetaioSDK v5 <br/><br/>

<h2 class="title">Description</h2>

<p id="desc">
CERTH has developed a library (LG_CERTH_Metaio_lib) to be used in any template app (e.g. LG_CityPlanning) in order 
to implement AR. The library acts as an intermediate connector between the MetaioSDK5 library and the template. 
One feature of the CERTH library is that implements ARView as a fragment that can be inserted into a tabhost next 
to a map and a list view. A functionality that was not included in the MetaioSDK5. 
An additional innovation is that both Location Based AR and Image Based AR functionalities are in the same fragment. 
The user can switch between the two ARs with a toggle button without having to reload the metaioSDK object.
</p>

<h2 class="title">Visualization of main classes</h2>

<p id="desc">
The app visualizations are shown in Figure 1. The Template consists of the main activity implemented by 
FActivity_Main.java which contains the tabhost for 'Map' implemented by Fragment_Map, 'AR' implemented 
by Fragment_AR_Twix.java, and 'List' implemented by Fragment_List.java fragment.

The Fragment_AR_Twix.java implements both LBS and IBS AR by the following way. The fragment starts 
by loading the LBS channel and showing only the billboards and two buttons:

The first button is a Toggle button (togg3d) which toggles between LBS 3d models and LBS billboards. The second 
button switches between LBS, IBS, and IBS* channels.
In the LBS mode the actions are coded in the following way:
<ol type="A" style="margin-left:50px">
<li>In Billboard mode, by clicking on a billboard then you go to ActivityPosterior.java;</li>
<li>In LBS 3d mode, by clicking on an Entity (3d model)</li>
    <ol type="a">
	<li>If the clicked Entity has no alternative 3d model then go to ctivityPosterior.java;</li>
	<li>If the clicked model has alternative 3d models then a new button (bt_models) 
	appears named as 'Shift models' which can be used to replace currently clicked model with the other alternative model;</li>
	<li>If the clicked Entity is 'reclicked' then go to ActivityPosterior.java;</li>
	<li>If another Entity is clicked then the 'Shift model' refers to the newly clicked;</li>
	</ol>
</ol>

LBS (AR Type button) switch between LBS, IBS, and IBS*. In IBS models are clickable and they lead to ActivityPosterior. 
In IBS* mode, a new button name as "Recon" appears. 
Recon button sends the current preview screen image to the remote server for recognition. If the image is recognized to belong to an Entity
(positive recognition score) and the Entity is within the range of the downloaded data, then the Entity appears in ActivityPosterior. 

CERTH library includes the ARViewFragment.java that enables the implementation of AR as a fragment. 
The object metaioSDK is available through the Interface IMetaioSDKAndroid.java.

<h2 class="title">Data</h2>

<p id="desc">
Most information about the urls and the local paths is included in: <br/>

<code>LG_CERTH_Metaio_lib.com.lg.ar_Core.Constants_API.java</code> <br/>

and the main function to download and store data is the:<br/>

<code>LG_CityPlanning.com.lg.ar_Template.FetchResources.java</code>



<ol type="a">
   <li><b>Download Data</b><br/><br/>
   
   The data is downloaded from the AR Server using the AREL api.<br/>
		<code>
		ServerName = "http://augreal.mklab.iti.gr";<br/>
		url_php_LBS = ServerName + "/api_AREL/LBS/index.php";<br/>
		url_php_IBS = ServerName + "/api_AREL/IBS/index.php";<br/>
		</code><br/>
		The main function that performs asynchronous downloading and local storing of data is the 
		FetchResources.java that it is included in the Template.
   
   </li><br>
   <li> <b>Store data locally</b><br/><br/>
   
		The main folder is the:</br>
		<code>localFolderSTR = "sdcard0/data/MetaioSDK";</code><br/><br/>
		The xmls are stored in: <br/>
		<code>fn_local_LBS_xml = localFolderSTR + "/LBS/arel.xml";
				fn_local_IBS_xml = localFolderSTR + "/IBS/arel.xml";</code><br/><br/>

      
		The 3d models and their images are in:<br/>
		<code>folder_Models3D = localFolderSTR + "/Models3D_DB";</code>
   
   </li><br/>


	  <li> <b>Use data</b><br/><br/>
 
 		The data is loaded into memory by the objects found the FetchResources.java:<br/>
		<code>List&lt;Entity> entitiesLBS</code><br/>
		<code>List&lt;Entity> entitiesIBS</code><br/><br/>
		
		Where an Entity contains: Id, title, iconurl, iconfile, location, description, modelurl, modelfile, type, trackingurl, nModels3d.<br/>
		See in javadoc for more details about each field.
      </li>
      
</ol>

<h2 class="title">Install and customize</h2>

<h3>Installation procedure</h3>


<ol>
<li>Import all three projects into your eclipse workspace.</li>
<li>Go to 'LG_CERTH_Metaio_lib' and import 'MetaioSDK5' as library in [Project Properties->Android]</li>
<li>Go to 'LG_CityPlanning' and import 'LG_CERTH_Metaio_lib' as library in [Project Properties->Android]</li>
</ol>

<p id="desc">
If there are errors: Clean all projects by [Project->Clean], delete 'gen' folders in each project, 
close all projects and reopen them. Then wait 5 seconds until the 'gen' folder is generated.<br/><br/>
You can now run the 'LG_CityPlanning'.
</p>

<h3>Customize</h3> 

<p id="desc">
The MetaioSDK API key can be found in 'LG_CityPlanning' -> res -> values -> signature. <br/><br/>

It depends on the package name of the project which is found in Android Manifest, and it is 'com.lg.ar_Template', 
and it also depends on the appname 'CityPlanning' which is found in res->values->strings.
By changing one of the above, the AR functionality will not be available. In order to generate 
a new API key, go to metaioSDK site: <a href="http://www.metaio.com/sdk/">http://www.metaio.com/sdk/</a> , log in and follow the instructions.
