<h1>iOS client</h1><br />

Quick Guide to build an iPhone AR app using the MetaioSDK v5 for the needs of L+G project<br/><br/>

<h2 class="title">Description</h2>

<p id="desc">
The iPhone AR Client consists of 1 template and 2 library projects:
<ol>
<li>LG_AR_Template</li>
<li>metaioSDK.framework, and </li>
<li>ASIHTTPRequest.framework.</li>
</ol>

<br/>
LG_AR_Template is the template to start working on for each use case. The metaioSDK.framework is 
the official library by Metaio, and the ASIHTTPRequest.framework is an http library for internet 
communication found in [https://github.com/pokeb/asi-http-request]. As it is seen, there is no 
intermediate library for connecting template with metaioSDK, but the necessary classes are 
inside the template. The problem for making an intermediate library for iOS is that MetaioSDK.framework 
needs several configurations that will make it hard to support in any future MetaioSDK releases.
</p>

<h2 class="title">Main classes</h2>

<p id="desc">
<code>ARELViewController.mm</code> is the file that creates the AR views and supports 5 AR "modes". 
The first 3 modes are used in L+G project and correspond to the 3 modes of the Android version, 
whereas the other 2 are modes are supported and they are described for reader's convenience. Namely:
<ol>
<li>Location Based with custom AREL interpreter: This creates an AR View without using the 
Metaio AREL interpreter but with an XML parser by CERTH which allows for high level of 
customizability e.g. custom billboards, radar, identifying the touched geometry etc. This mode 
requires as input the XML of the AR-Server LBS php script.</li>
<li>Image Based (Tracking application, IBS): This view uses a tracking image to render 3d objects on the user's screen.</li>
<li>Image Based Recognition (Object Recognition, IBS*): This view captures frames from the camera and using the 
visual recognition service by CERTH recognizes an object. A recognition score is shown in the screen 
and if it exceeds the 0 threshold, a related 3d model is rendered on the center of the screen.</li>
<br/>
The 2 modes that are not used in L+G project:
<br/>
<li>Location Based for other data available in memory: This demonstrates how to create an AR View with your own 
data which can be retrieved from a different source other than AR-Server.</li>
<li>Location Based with Metaio's AREL interpreter: A Location Based AR view using the Metaio's AREL interpreter. 
This view doesn't allow much customization of the view.</li>
</ol>

Detailed examples on how to instantiate this controller are shown in <code>ViewController.mm</code> file from 
the metaio XCode project (see <code>startARWithOptions</code> function). Depending on your location 
you may not be able to see any billboards/3d models in the location based AR View because the distance 
of the entities exceeds a certain threshold. This threshold prevents data to be rendered on the 
screen. To configure the rendering distance threshold you may need to call the following functions 
(please refer to the metaioSDK documenation for this; the default max distance is set to 10 km):
<ol>
<li>m_metaioSDK->setRendererClippingPlaneLimits</li>
<li>m_metaioSDK->setLLAObjectRenderingLimits</li>
</ol>
For location based applications you will have to define a View Controller class to launch 
when the geometry is touched. In the <code>touchesBegan</code> method in <code>ARELViewController.mm</code> and define your own.

<h2 class="title">Install and customize</h2>

<h3>Installation procedure</h3>

Three projects should be included in the XCode workspace:
<ol>
<li>LG_AR_Template</li>
<li>metaioSDK.framework (Metaio library, included in SVN), and</li> 
<li>ASIHTTPRequest.framework (included in SVN)).</li>
</ol>

<p id="desc">
Add the following frameworks to your project's ""Link binary with libraries"" build phase: 
metaioSDK.framework, ASIHTTPRequest.framework, CoreLocation.framework, libz.dylib, 
libxml2.dylib, CoreMotion.framework, OpenGLES.framework, AudioToolbox.framework, 
QuartzCore.framework, CoreVideo.framework, CoreMedia.framework, AVFoundation.framework, 
MediaPlayer.framework, EventKit.framework, Security.framework, CFNetwork.framework, 
SystemConfiguration.framework, MobileCoreServices.framework, UIKit.framework, 
Foundation.framework, CoreGraphics.framework. These are shown in the Figure 1.

<p id="desc">
In the build settings of the target specify "Framework search paths"" as <code>$(SRCROOT)/</code> as shown in Figure 2:

<figcaption>Figure 2: Path modifications to find frameworks.</figcaption></br>
</figure>

<p id="desc">Copy-paste the following files from the Metaio project into your workspace: 
MetaioSDKViewController.mm; MetaioSDKViewController.h; MetaioSDKViewController.xib, EAGLView.h; 
EAGLView.mm; XMLReader.h; XMLReader.mm; ARELViewController.h; 
ARELViewController.mm; ARELViewController.xib; ic_radar.png; red.png; poi.bundle; 
cancel.png; 3dON.png; 3dOFF.png.
</p>

<p id="desc">
Navigate to the project Build Phases again and add the <code>-fno-objc-arc</code> compiler flags to the files 
<code>EAGLView.mm</code> and <code>MetaioSDKViewController.mm</code> as shown in Figure 3:

<p id="desc">
In the "Build Settings"" of the project find the Apple LLVM compiler section and change the following 
to "Compiler Default" as shown below:

<p id="desc">
Every .m file in your project that references c++ code (e.g. ARELViewController) should be renamed with the .mm extension.
</p>

<h3>Customize</h3> 

<p id="desc">
Mobile AR client iPhone requires a MetaioSDK api key in order to be functional. 
An account to MetaioSDK site is mandatory [www.metaio.com/sdk]. Go to "My Apps"" tab 
and in Application name put the name of your application, e.g. "LG_CityPlanning", 
and in Application identifier the package name, e.g. com.mycompany.myapp. 
The SDK version that should be selected is 5.X. For iPhone, specify the Metaio API key 
in the file <code>MetaioSDKViewController.mm</code> and search for the <code>#define</code> string on 
top of the file. The projects already include a valid key but it should change if the 
project packages or names will be renamed.
